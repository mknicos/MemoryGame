Version 2 of the Memory Game. The game mimics that of the classic
memory card game in which the user attempts to match two cards
out of a group of them. The cards values are randomly generated,
and therefore its a different game every time, card values are stored in memory
and only reference a random array, and therefore no cheating can be used.

Only current bug is non optimal function if the same card is clicked on twice in
a row.

Future updates hope to include an option menu allowing you to change appearance such
as card design. Also possibly a timer
